Canvas2ImagePlugin
============

Installation
------------

This plugin allows you to save the contents of an HTML canvas tag to the iOS Photo Library from your app.

Add the plugin much like any other:

1.	Add the Canvas2ImagePlugin.h, Canvas2ImagePlugin.m classes to your Plugins folder in Xcode (use "Create groups for any added folders")
2.	Add the Canvas2ImagePlugin.js file to your www folder
3.	Add the Canvas2ImagePlugin.js to your html file. eg: `<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="Canvas2ImagePlugin.js"></script>`
4.	Add the plugin to your config.xml `<plugin name="Canvas2ImagePlugin" value="Canvas2ImagePlugin" />` (or if you are using an older version of PhoneGap / Cordova, the Cordova.plist under Plugins (key: "Canvas2ImagePlugin" value: "Canvas2ImagePlugin"))


Finally, call the `saveImageDataToLibrary()` method using success and error callbacks and the id attribute of the canvas to save:

### Example
```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="165px" height="145px"></canvas>
```

```javascript
function onDeviceReady()
{
	var canvas2ImagePlugin = window.plugins.canvas2ImagePlugin;
	canvas2ImagePlugin.saveImageDataToLibrary(
		function(msg){
			console.log(msg);
		}, 
		function(err){
			console.log(err);
		}, 
		'myCanvas'
	);
}
```
